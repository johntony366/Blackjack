#Rules of Blackjack

*The dealer gets one card to start (in real life, the dealer gets two, but one is face down so it doesn’t matter at this point).

*The player gets two cards to start.

*The player goes first.

*A player can repeatedly “hit” or “stand”.

*If the player “stands”, their turn is over, and their score is calculated based on the cards they have been dealt.

*If the player “hits”, they get another card and the value of that card is added to their total score.

*An ace counts as 1 or 11, whichever is better in your situation.

*If the player goes over a score of 21, they bust and lose immediately.

*The dealer goes after the player.

*The dealer repeatedly draws until they reach a score of 17 or more, at which point they stand.

*If the dealer goes over a score of 21, they bust and the player wins immediately.

*Otherwise, if the player has a higher score than the dealer, the player wins. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
